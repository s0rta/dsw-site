Hi <%= @submission.submitter.try(:name) || @submission.contact_email %>,

Thanks for submitting "<%= @submission.title %>" for consideration for Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>!

The final day for submitting sessions is <%= AnnualSchedule.current.cfp_close_at.to_s(:month_day) %>.  During the month of May, we'll review everything that we've received and fire up the feedback engine for the startup community to comment and vote on the sessions that they want to see in the final schedule.  We'll be in touch with you in late April with more details as the commenting and voting process opens.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please hit us up on Twitter (@denstartupweek) or via e-mail (info@denverstartupweek.org).

Thank you again for volunteering to be a part of Denver Startup Week. This is a community event that would not be possible without you!

Cheers,

The DSW Organizing Committee
