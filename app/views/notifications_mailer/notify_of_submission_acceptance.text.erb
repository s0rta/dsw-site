Hello!

First of all, sorry for how long it's taken us to get this note out to you.

But congratulations! Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been selected to be part of the <%= @submission.track.name %> Track program during Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>.

<%- if @submission.time_assigned? %>
  We’ve scheduled it for <%= @submission.human_start_day %> <%= @submission.start_datetime.strftime('%B %e') %> at <%= @submission.human_start_time %>.
<%- else %>
  We have not scheduled it for a timeslot yet but will be doing so shortly.
<%- end %>

As a session organizer, you will have a 90 minute slot available to fill as you see fit. You are not, however, required to fill the entire allotted time. For example, many presenters elect to do a 60-75 minute session followed by 15-30 minutes of Q&A.

Please reply to this email to let us know (as soon as you are able, but no later than August 15) that you’re willing and able to present this session at that time. Unfortunately, due to the size of the event, we have very limited ability to accommodate requests for time slot changes. If we don’t receive confirmation from you by August 15, we will cede your slot to another session from our waitlist.

VENUES

We are currently working on booking venues based on schedule availability, track locality, and expected attendance. If you have already secured a venue on your own, please note that in your response. Otherwise, we will reach out with additional logistics on your assigned venue in the next few weeks.

TITLE & DESCRIPTION UPDATES

We have created a section of the site where you can submit updates to the title and description for your session, should you wish to do so. For more information, visit https://www.denverstartupweek.org/panel-picker/mine and follow the instructions there. Over the course of the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out a function to indicate individual speakers for your sessions as well - stay tuned for that!

MANDATORY PRESENTER ORIENTATION

In order to help ensure consistency and high quality in all our sessions, this year we are asking that all session organizers attend one of our orientation sessions. The sessions cover event logistics, volunteer coordination, session promotion, branding, and more. In order to accomodate as many schedules as possible, we're offering the session at two different times - once during the business day and once in the evening.

Please register for one of these sessions via the Eventbrite links below:

Tuesday, August 30, 2016 from 5:30 to 6:30 pm at The Commons on Champa (1245 Champa St.)

OTHER EVENTS

We will have 200+ other events throughout the week and would love to see you take part in some of them. The full schedule will be publicized and registration opens the week of August 15th.

Per the above, please reply back as soon as possible to confirm you are still willing and able to host this session. We will be in touch with you over the next couple of weeks with additional details.

Please feel free to reply to this e-mail with any questions as well - we’re here to help!
